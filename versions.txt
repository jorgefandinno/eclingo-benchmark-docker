- Which operating systems and version are you using?

NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server"
VERSION="7.9 (Maipo)"

Are you using pyqasp or qasp.jar? Which version of python/java are you using to run this?

I'm using the executable qasp for elp2qasp as in the script elp-qasp for eligible. As for bomb and yale I'm using qasp.jar with the following example command:
java -Xmx1g -Xms512m -Xss512k -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=256m -XX:HeapBaseMinAddress=4g -jar ${SCRIPT_DIR}/qasp.jar

They should be in elp-qasp-bomb in benchmark-tool/programs and in benchmarks/qasp/yale/*.sh respectively.

I'll make sure to indicate for each benchmark what is the necessary version and requirements in a README file.
